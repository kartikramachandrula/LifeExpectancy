# LifeExpectancy

Life expectancy is at the heart of health research and policy making. Predicting world longevity can help the public sector and private institutions in budget allocation, policy development, social programs that can bring meaningful lives to the aging population while also contributing to the workforce. This project seeks to identify factors that contribute to longevity as well as predicting the total population of a given country based on historical data. The dataset is extracted from Kaggle and contains attributes that range from location (Country Name, Region), literacy, and government budget spent on human rights. In this work, we first analyze various trends between features that reveal important information for translational fields. Further, using various regression models, we aim to accurately predict the life-expectancy of macroscopic entities. Our models are to be measured for accuracy using the Mean Square Error and R-Squared Score. This model intends to predict the area and countries with a higher life expectancy, and correlate what factors are driving such longevity or lack thereof.
